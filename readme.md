# Cards Notes project
This is a special project created using Laravel 5.3 version. It includes several models (cards and child notes of them, meaning that they have a relationship),
user login/register system and administrator type of user (which has more permissions than a regular one). So in the project you can find views with conditions
(they regulate who can access some type of action). Additionally there is MustBeAdministrator middleware which checks if user is admin. There is card and note
addition forms with pre-configured csrf fields. The project is production ready. Feel free to start your own projects from this one. 

# Laravel PHP Framework

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
